# AngularJS Phonecat hybrid with Angular

This project shows a complete hybrid application with the official Angular tutorial on [PhoneCat Upgrade Tutorial](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)]. I found some problems with the tutorial, in particular with the configuration of SystemJS (systemjs.config.js) and Typescript.

You can follow the commits on main branch to see the changes I made to make the project work or follow the branches named with the "step" prefix.
